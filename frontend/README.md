# rUv-engineer Frontend

This is the frontend for rUv-engineer. It's built using [vite](https://vitejs.dev), [React](https://reactjs.org), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) as a SPA.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

In a separate terminal navigate to the backend directory and run:

```bash
cd openui/backend
pip install -e .
python -m openui --dev
```

All changes should now be live reloaded, god speed.

## Additional Capabilities

rUv-engineer includes additional capabilities such as cloud deployment, multi-step reasoning, handling more than one file at a time, and other enhancements.

## Credit

This project is based on OpenUI. We thank the OpenUI team for their contributions.
